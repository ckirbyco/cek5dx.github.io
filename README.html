<h1>Welcome!</h1>

Hi! My name is Caroline Kirby and this is going to be all about cute pets! I actually have a cat named Howard, but I've always wanted a dog too. However, now that I'm here at college I have to wait. It sucks not being able to see your pets very often, but I can live. My classes are keeping me very busy anyways, so not much time to miss him!
