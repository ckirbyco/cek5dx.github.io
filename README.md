<h1>Welcome!</h1>

Hi! My name is Caroline Kirby and this is going to be all about **cute pets**! I actually have a cat named Howard, but I've always wanted a dog too. However, now that I'm here at college I have to wait. It **sucks** not being able to see your pets very often, but I can live. I'm too tired from my classes to miss him that much anyways!
