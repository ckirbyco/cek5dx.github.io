    <h1>Why are cats better than dogs?</h1>

    <p1>
      Because thats just how things are, and here's a list if you need more evidence.
      <br>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Cats dont really care about you, so they'll leave you alone when you want them too. However, they can also be super affectionate and cat cuddles are the <b>best</b>.</li>
        <li>Cats are smarter than dogs.</li>
        <li>Cats will bring you presents. The other day my cat, Howard, actually brought a bird into the house. <b>How fun!</b></li>
      </ol>
