<h1>Why are cats better than dogs?</h1>

<p1>
  Because thats just how things are, and here's a list if you need more evidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  
  1. Cats dont really care about you, so they'll leave you alone when you want them too. However, they can also be super affectionate and cat cuddles are the   **best**.
  2. Cats are smarter than dogs.
  3. Cats will bring you presents. The other day my cat, Howard, actually brought a bird into the house. **How fun!**
